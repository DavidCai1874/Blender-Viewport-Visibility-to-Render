# Blender-Viewport-Visibility-to-Render

The code has been moved to : [Blender-Viewport-And-Render-Visibility-Sync-Addon](https://github.com/DavidCai1874/Blender-Viewport-And-Render-Visibility-Sync-Addon)
This is just a legacy artifact that will be removed after re-doc of the tool and my [website doc](https://davidcai1874.github.io/my-tech-art-station/troubleshooting/blender/ts-b-0001)
